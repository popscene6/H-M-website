            <div class="panel">
              <p>To assist in preventing termite infestation in your building,
                please follow these tips:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Do not place dirt or landscaping within 6 inches of the exterior
                foundation and 2 to 3 inches below the first brick for a thorough
                visual inspection and complete chemical barrier.</li>
                <li>Keep all ivy and plants from growing next to or on the exterior
                foundation.</li>
                <li> Avoid stacking firewood or other woods within 25 feet of a
                home without a metal base or stand.</li>
                <li> Avoid using mulch for landscaping neat the exterior. Mulch needs
                to be 6-12 inches from the foundation.</li>
                <li>Keep surrounding dirt around your home moisture free. Re-locate
                or re-direct sprinkler systems that wet within 8-12 inches of the
                structure and maintain gutters to prevent leaks and ensure proper
                drainage.</li>
                <li>Maintain the chemical barrier protecting your home. Annual termite
                renewals should be completed when due and a complete ground barrier
                treatment should be applied every 5 years to maintain efficacy.</li>
                <li>Repair any pipe leaks or roof leaks as quickly as possible and
                clear gutter clogs to prevent water build-up.</li>
                <li> Watch for termite "mud" trails up and on the slab or piers of
                the building and alert your termite professionals at the first sighting.</li>
                <li>During swarming season: Keep your outside lights off in the evening.</li>
              </ul>
